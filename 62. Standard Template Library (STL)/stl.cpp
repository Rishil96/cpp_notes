// Standard Template Library

/*
    Standard Template Library:-
        - it is a library of generic classes and functions. Uses templates.
        - when we use STL, we reuse well tested components.
        - Saves a lot of time.
        - components of STL are:-
            1. Containers - uses template classes to store data.
            2. Algorithms - set of instructions used to process data. uses template functions.
            3. Iterators - used to iterate over a container. just like a pointer. connects algo with containers.
        
        STL = Containers + Algorithms + Iterators

/*
    Containers:
        Types of containers are:-
            1. Sequence Containers : Stores data in a linear way.
                                    Examples: Vector, List, Dequeue
            2. Associative Containers : Stores data in a way that gives direct access.(key value pair)
                                        Examples: Set, Multiset, Map, Multimap 
            3. Derived Containers : Derived from Sequence or Associative containers. Real world modelling.
                                    Examples: Stack, Queue, Priority Queue
