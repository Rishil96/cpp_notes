Inheritance

    - Reusability is an important feature of OOP
    - In C++ we can reuse a class and add additional features to it.
    - Easier testing and debugging.
    - The existing class is called Base Class and the class inheriting from the Base Class is called     
      Derived class.

    - Types of Inheritance:-
        1. Single
        2. Multiple
        3. Hierarchical
        4. Multilevel
        5. Hybrid
    
    - Single Inheritance: One Derived class with only one Base class.

    - Multiple Inheritance: One Derived class with multiple(more than one) Base classes.

    - Hierarchical Inheritance: Several Derived classes from a single Base class.

    - Multilevel Inheritance: Deriving a class from an already Derived class.

    - Hybrid Inheritance: is a combination of Multiple and Multilevel Inheritance.
