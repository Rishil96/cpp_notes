Object Oriented Programming

    - OOP : is a way/approach of writing programs
    - C++ was designed with the intention to add OOP features to C language
    - Creator of C++ : Bjarne Stroustrup
    - C++ was earlier called "C with classes"
    - Creating a class is like creating a datatype
    - Class is a template to create objects.
 
Basic Concepts of OOP
 
    1. Classes: Basic template for creating objects.
    
    2. Objects: Basic run time entities.
    
    3. Data Abstraction: means displaying only essential information and hiding the background details and implementation. 
    
    4. Data Encapsulation: Wrapping data and functions into single unit to make sure that "sensitive" data  hidden from users.
    
    5. Inheritance: Properties of one class can be inherited to others.
    
    6. Polymorphism: ability to take more than one forms. Function overloading is an example.
    
    7. Dynamic Binding: code which will execute is not known until the program runs. Example, executing some code depending on what the user gives as input.
    
    8. Message Passing: Object.message(Information) call format.

Benfits of OOP

    1. Better code reuseability using objects and inheritance.
    2. Principle of data hiding helps build secure systems.
    3. Multiple objects can co-exist without any interference.
    4. Software complexity can be easily managed.
