Constructors in Derived Classes

    - can be used in Derived Classes
    - If Base Class Constructors does not have any arguments, then no need to create a constructor for Derived class.
    - If there are 1 or more arguments in the Base class constructor, then Derived class needs to pass those arguments to the Base class constructor.
    - If both Base and Derived classes have constructors, then the Base class constructor will be executed first.

Constructors in Multiple Inheritance

    - If derived class C is derived from Base classes A and B:-
    - Base classes are constructed in the order that they appear in the class declaration.
    - In Multilevel Inheritance, the base classes are constructed in the order of Inheritance.

Special Syntax

    - C++ supports a special syntax for passing args to multiple base class constructors.
    - The constructor of the Derived class will receive all the arguments at once and then will pass the calls to the respective Base class constructors.

Special Case of Virtual Base class.
    
    - Constructors of Virtual base classes are invoked before any non-Virtual base class.
    - In case of multiple virtual base classes, the constructors are invoked in the order of declaration.
    - Any non-virtual base class are then constructed before constructing the derived class.
